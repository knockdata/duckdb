// Works out what this release still has to do, before any build starts.
//
// A duckdb build is 15-40 minutes per platform. Publishing is the last step of each leg, so
// without this a rerun of a half-published release would compile everything again just to
// discover npm already has it. Here the already-published platforms are dropped from the
// matrix, so those runners never start at all.
//
// Writes GitHub Actions outputs:
//   platforms=[{os,platform,arch,vcpkgTriplet}, ...]   the legs still worth running
//   universal=true|false                  whether the universal package still needs publishing
//
//   node scripts/plan.mjs                 prints them, for reading by eye
