//   node scripts/trust.mjs                     show what it would configure, change nothing
//   node scripts/trust.mjs --apply             configure all seven
//   node scripts/trust.mjs --apply --otp=123456
//
// Publishing is 2FA protected, so npm authenticates before each change. With browser-based 2FA
// it prints a URL and waits for you to approve — that is expected, not a hang. Accounts that use
// authenticator codes instead can pass --otp.
//
// It keeps going after a failure rather than aborting, so a rerun only has to get through
// whatever is still missing. Check the result with: npx -y npm@11 trust list @knockdata/duckdb
//
// The npm version matters more than it looks. `npm trust` arrived in 11.15.0, but the
// --allow-publish permission flag came later, and the registry rejects a trust request carrying
// no permissions as a bare "400 Bad Request" — nothing about what is missing.
//
// The npx spec is an exact version rather than a range for the same reason: `npx npm@11` will
// reuse whatever 11.x is already in the npx cache, which here silently ran 11.11.0 and produced
// exactly that 400. npm@latest is 12.x and needs a newer node, so this pins a known-good 11.
